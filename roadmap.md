Here's your **CryptoXplor** roadmap broken down into **phases** with detailed checklists, starting from **environment setup** to **feature implementation**, in the style you requested:

---

### 🟠 **PHASE 1: Environment & Tooling Setup**

#### 🎯 Goal: Set up your working structure and development environment.

* [] Initialize Git repository & set up project folder
* [] Create two folders: `client/` (React + Vite) and `server/` (Express)
* [] Set up Vite + React + Tailwind CSS in `client/`
* [] Set up Node.js + Express server in `server/`
* [] Install and configure MongoDB using Mongoose in `server/`
* [] Create and configure `.env` files in both `client/` and `server/`
* [] Install and configure `concurrently` or `npm-run-all` to run both servers

---

### 🟢 **PHASE 2: Authentication Integration (Clerk + MetaMask)**

#### 🎯 Goal: Allow users to log in using Clerk and connect wallets via MetaMask.

* [] Set up Clerk project and get frontend API key
* [] Integrate Clerk in React app using `@clerk/clerk-react`
* [] Add `<ClerkProvider>`, `<SignIn />`, `<SignUp />`, and route protection
* [] Store logged-in user info in state or MongoDB
* [] Add “Connect Wallet” button for MetaMask
* [] Use `ethers.js` to connect wallet and get wallet address
* [] Store connected wallet address in state

---

### 🔵 **PHASE 3: Wallet & Token Data Retrieval**

#### 🎯 Goal: Display user wallet balance and basic token info.

* [ ] Use `ethers.js` to fetch ETH balance from connected wallet
* [ ] Integrate CoinGecko API to retrieve token prices
* [ ] Optionally retrieve ERC-20 token balances (advanced)
* [ ] Display balances and token info in a dashboard UI

---

### 🟣 **PHASE 4: Crypto Dashboard (Prices, Charts, Search)**

#### 🎯 Goal: Show live prices, search coins, and render graphs.

* [ ] Fetch top coins and prices from CoinGecko API
* [ ] Implement search functionality for specific coins
* [ ] Use Chart.js or Recharts to show price history charts
* [ ] Display current price, change %, market cap for each token

---

### 🟡 **PHASE 5: Coin Conversion (Simulation Only)**

#### 🎯 Goal: Simulate coin conversion based on real-time prices.

* [ ] Create form for selecting "From" and "To" coins + amount
* [ ] Fetch conversion rate using CoinGecko API
* [ ] Calculate converted amount and display result
* [ ] Optionally log simulated conversions to MongoDB
* [ ] Show conversion history in a separate dashboard tab

---

### 🟤 **PHASE 6: Backend API Development**

#### 🎯 Goal: Set up and secure your backend services.

* [ ] Create REST endpoints:

  * [ ] `/api/user` – Store and retrieve user data
  * [ ] `/api/history` – Log and fetch conversion history
* [ ] Set up Clerk JWT verification middleware
* [ ] Connect backend to MongoDB Atlas
* [ ] Add error handling and data validation

---

### ⚫ **PHASE 7: UI/UX Polish & Responsiveness**

#### 🎯 Goal: Make the interface clean, responsive, and intuitive.

* [ ] Design dashboard layout with Tailwind (cards, grids, modals)
* [ ] Add loading spinners, error toasts, and form validation
* [ ] Make the app mobile-friendly with responsive Tailwind classes
* [ ] Add optional dark/light mode toggle

---

### ⚪ **PHASE 8: Deployment**

#### 🎯 Goal: Launch your full-stack app online.

* [ ] Deploy frontend (client) to **Vercel**
* [ ] Deploy backend (server) to **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku**
* [ ] Use **MongoDB Atlas** for production database
* [ ] Set up production environment variables on hosting platforms
* [ ] Test full user flow on production environment
