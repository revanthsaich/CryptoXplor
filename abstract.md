## üî∑ **Project Title: CryptoXplor ‚Äì A MERN-Based Crypto Portfolio Dashboard with Wallet & Clerk Authentication**

### üîç **Abstract:**

**CryptoXplor** is a modern cryptocurrency portfolio dashboard developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3 by integrating traditional login systems (via Clerk) with decentralized wallet connections (via MetaMask). The platform empowers users to explore their crypto holdings, monitor real-time market data, view token history, and simulate coin conversions‚Äîall from a unified, user-friendly dashboard.

This project is designed for crypto enthusiasts who want a simplified way to track their assets, access live price data, and interact with Web3 wallets in a secure and efficient environment.
