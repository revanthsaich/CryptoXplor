## üî∑ **Project Title: CryptoXplor ‚Äì A MERN-Based Crypto Portfolio Dashboard with Wallet & Clerk Authentication**

### üîç **Abstract:**

**CryptoXplor** is a modern cryptocurrency portfolio dashboard developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3 by integrating traditional login systems (via Clerk) with decentralized wallet connections (via MetaMask). The platform empowers users to explore their crypto holdings, monitor real-time market data, simulate coin conversions, and calculate hypothetical profits or losses from virtual trades‚Äîall from a unified, user-friendly dashboard.

In addition to live market tracking and wallet integration, CryptoXplor includes a user-specific dashboard displaying profile information, conversion history, and a virtual trading module. This module allows users to simulate the purchase of cryptocurrencies at chosen prices and quantities, helping them estimate potential profit or loss without actual transactions.

This project is designed for crypto enthusiasts who want a simplified yet powerful way to track assets, interact with wallets, and experiment with trading strategies securely.
